"""
gestalt_handoff.py -- the deterministic/LLM boundary of the NYCH pipeline.

Pipeline, per the NYCH design:

    USER -> natural-language input -> NYCH encoder (deterministic, this
    package) -> ... -> Gestalt mapping (LLM discretion) -> MG8 engine

Everything up to Gestalt mapping is pre-LLM: the state representation
(state_roles.tag_roles), the relational tense, the action, the domain and
subdomain, the vernacular competency (competency.analyze_utterance), the
TOTE-loop lookup (tote_lookup.lookup_loop). All of that is extracted FIRST,
before any word is Gestalt-mapped to any symbol.

At Gestalt mapping, discretion is deferred to an LLM, because there aren't
enough symbols to handle all of English. The rules handed over with that
discretion:

    1. map by most obvious visual match;
    2. embed the word sans vowels and doubled consonants into the id
       string as a disambiguation clue (skeleton.py);
    3. the four modality operators are invariant -- never remapped;
    4. once a word is mapped this session it is pinned #temp-invariant
       (session_invariants.py) and reused, never re-decided;
    5. chunk/compress whatever of the deterministic findings can be
       compressed before rendering symbol matches;
    6. scientific names, names of people, and prescription drug names are
       NOT rendered into Gestalt -- they pass through literally
       (protected_terms.py), with no glyph, skeleton id, or session pin.

This module builds that handoff package. It does NOT call an LLM -- nych
stays deterministic end to end; the caller (e.g. mg8-engine's gate loop)
owns the LLM boundary and passes this package as the prompt context.

Honesty note: `build_handoff` reports exactly what the deterministic side
found, including UNRESOLVED domains, None roles, and TOTE fallbacks. Words
already pinned this session appear under "pinned", not "needs_mapping" --
nothing already decided is re-opened.
