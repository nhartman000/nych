"""
gst_export.py -- package the deterministic NYCH findings as a .gst pretext
file for the LLM pruning + Gestalt-mapping step.

Per the NYCH design: the inverse-transform/dither pruning is performed by
an LLM, not by deterministic code. Narrowing the problemspace by the factor
of the inverse transform -- the coarse domain prune, the subdomain prune,
and the competency check within domain, with a controlled boundary-leakage
margin ("dither") -- is accomplished by the LLM, and all the initial
deterministic findings are passed to it as the pretext in a .gst file.

The shape here is grounded against mg8-engine's actual Gst model
(src/mg8_engine/models.py): plain JSON, `extra="allow"`, with optional
gst_version / state_id / state / domain fields. Everything nych adds rides
under the extra key "nych_pretext" so the engine's Gst parser accepts the
file unchanged.

Honesty note: this module serializes what the deterministic side found --
including UNRESOLVED domains, None competency, and TOTE fallbacks -- and
the instructions for the LLM. It does not execute the pruning, call an
LLM, or guess any field it couldn't compute.
